Hello we are Sesher , we are an alternative rock outfit with a variety of sounding songs. We have poppy rock songs that you can dance to along with Stoner rock influenced songs. Sesher is influenced by a vast variety of artists from Black Sabbath and Led Zepplin to the likes of Soundgarden, Alice in Chains, and Nirvana. You will find something that you like in our repertuar. Sesher consists of four members each equally as important. Lukas is our singer who is an opera studies major and started singing opera before joining this hard rock band. Matthew is the bass player who has played  alongside his dad who is a professional organ player in New Orleans. Matt has also played in his own band called Latitude 90. Both Luke and Matt are native to New Orleans while the other band members are non-natives. Erik the guitar player is from New Jersey and was in the previous band Twisted Times before forming Sesher here in New Orleans. Twisted times was a stepping stone for Erik to explore the world of being in a band.  On drums is Aj. Aj is a hard rock drummer who enjoys playing and writing music. He works and records for his solo project. The connection between all of the band members is extremely tight and the music just keeps flowing. Erik and Matt are the main songwriters of the group and tend to write a song anytime they put their mind to it. Sesher is working very hard to release a single for an upcoming album coming out by the end of the school year. Hope you enjoy our music and Sesh on.
